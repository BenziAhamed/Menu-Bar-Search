## Change log
- 1.0 - Initial Release
- 1.1 - Added Fuzzy Text Matching for Menus

  If you have a menu item `New Tab`, then typing `m nt` in Alfred will match `New Tab`, since `n` and `t` matches the first letters of the menu text.

- 1.1.1 - Changed run behaviour to terminate previous script, this makes the experience slightly more faster
- 1.2 - Completely native menu clicking, removed reliance on AppleScript
- 1.2.1 - Performance improvements when generating menus using direct JSON encoding
- 1.2.2 - More performance improvements while filtering menu items
