## Usage

Type `m` in Alfred to list menu bar items for front most application
You can filter menu items by name, or do a fuzzy search.

E.g

- `m new tab` will match the menu item **New Tab**
- `m cw` will match the menu item **Close Window**


## Settings

You can change the workflow environment variables to fine tune menu listings

* -show-disabled    true/false    controls if diabled menu items should be shown (default is false)

*  -no-apple-menu    true/false    if true, no menus items under the apple menu will be shown (default is true)

*  -max-children    number    how many sub-menu items to load for each menu item (default is 30)

*  -max-depth    number    how many nested levels if sub menus should be listed (default is 10)



## Change log

- 1.0 - Initial Release
- 1.1 - Added Fuzzy Text Matching for Menus

  If you have a menu item `New Tab`, then typing `m nt` in Alfred will match `New Tab`, since `n` and `t` matches the first letters of the menu text.
