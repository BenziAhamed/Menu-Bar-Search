### Running on macOS Catalina and beyond (v1.8+)
If you face issues from Catalina or beyond, in relation to not being able to run the workflow due to security issues (e.g. malicious software checks), have a look at https://github.com/BenziAhamed/Menu-Bar-Search/issues/4 for possible workarounds.

> I am working to fix and resolve this.

## Usage

- Type `m` in Alfred to list menu bar items for front most application.
- You can filter menu items by name, or do a fuzzy search.
- Alternatively, set a hotkey to trigger the workflow as well.

E.g

- `m new tab` will match the menu item **New Tab**
- `m cw` will match the menu item **Close Window**

## Credits

- Based on the ctwise's ObjC implementation of [Menu Bar Search](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1993-menu-search/), which I've ported over to Swift and added caching and per app configuration to speed things up.
